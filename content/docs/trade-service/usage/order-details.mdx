Fetch detailed information about a previously registered swap intent using the order ID. This API returns the status, route, fee, swapper inputs/outputs, and execution steps associated with the order. It is typically used to track the progress or outcome of a swap intent. Check out the [`orderDetails`](https://github.com/okto-hq/okto-sdkv2-trade-service-template-app/tree/main/src/api) API template script for implementation details.

**Understanding Order Status**

The `orderData.status` field in the response indicates your order’s current state:

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `-1` | Order expired. The order did not register on-chain. Terminal state. |
| `0` | Order received by the backend but not yet registered on-chain. |
| `1` | Order registered on-chain but not yet filled. |
| `2` | Order settled successfully. Terminal state. |
| `3` | Order in dispute. The order was filled but not yet settled. |
| `4` | Order refunded. The order was not filled, and user was refunded. Terminal state. |
