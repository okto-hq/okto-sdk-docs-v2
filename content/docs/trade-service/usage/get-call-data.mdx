          Generate the complete calldata required to execute a token swap
          transaction on-chain. This API prepares the encoded calldata based on
          the selected route, amount, tokens, slippage, and fee configurations.
          It supports both same-chain and cross-chain swaps and includes
          optional permit data for approvals. Check out the
          [`getCallData`](https://github.com/okto-hq/okto-sdkv2-ts-template/blob/main/src/trade-service/index.ts)
          API template script for implementation details.
