Generate the complete calldata required to execute a token swap transaction on-chain. This API prepares the encoded calldata based on the selected route, amount, tokens, slippage, and fee configurations. It supports both same-chain and cross-chain swaps and includes optional permit data for approvals. Check out the [`getCallData`](https://github.com/okto-hq/okto-sdkv2-trade-service-template-app/tree/main/src/api) API template script for implementation details.
