The Okto Trade Service provides a comprehensive API suite for executing token swaps across multiple blockchain networks. This guide walks you through the setup process and explains the correct order of API execution for successful swaps.

## Quick Start

### Step 0: Prerequisites

To access the Trade Service APIs, you need to authenticate your requests using an API key. Please contact the Okto team at `deverel@coindcx.com` to request your Trade Service API credentials.

## Order of Execution

<Callout type="tip" title="Integration Flow">
The Trade Service follows a specific execution order: **Get Quote (Optional) → Get Best Route → Get Call Data → Register Intent → Monitor Status**
</Callout>

Execute the Trade Service APIs in this specific order for successful token swaps:

<Steps>

### Step 1: Get Quote (Optional)

The `getQuote` API gives you a real-time estimate of the swap's outcome. This step is optional but recommended for providing a good user experience.

**Purpose:** To determine how much of the destination token the user will receive for their source token amount, giving an idea of what the whole transaction will cost.

To see which assets are supported, check the [Supported Chains and FST](/docs/trade-service/supported-networks-tokens).

<Callout type="note" title="Independent APIs">
Get Quote and Get Best Route are not sequential — they can be used independently or together. Use Get Quote for faster previews and Get Best Route for detailed execution planning.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Get Best Route

The `getBestRoute` API finds the most optimal route for your swap. This step is **mandatory** before executing any swap.

**Purpose:** To calculate the optimal route by considering factors like fees, price impact, and liquidity.

[Learn more about Get Best Route →](/docs/trade-service/usage/get-best-route)

<Callout title="Handling Non-FST Tokens" type="info">
For cross-chain swaps, if the user's source token is not a [Filler-Supported Token (FST)](/docs/trade-service/supported-networks-tokens), this API will define a route that includes an intermediate swap. The source token will first be converted into a supported FST on the source chain before being bridged. Learn more in our [Swap Scenarios](/docs/trade-service/scenarios) documentation.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Get Transaction Call Data

After determining the best route, you need to fetch the transaction data that the user will sign.

**Purpose:** To generate the encoded `calldata` for the on-chain transaction.

The response from this API contains the transaction object that must be passed to the user's wallet for signing.

[Learn more about Get Call Data →](/docs/trade-service/usage/get-call-data)

### Step 4: Register Intent

Once the user signs the transaction, the next step depends on whether it's a same-chain or cross-chain swap.

- For same-chain swaps, use the calldata to execute the transaction directly through the user's wallet.
- For cross-chain swaps, register the intent with Okto.

[Learn more about Register Intent →](/docs/trade-service/usage/register-intent)

### Step 5: Monitor Order Status

After the intent is registered, you need to monitor its status until completion. This is a post-execution step.

**Purpose:** To track the progress of the swap and confirm its final outcome (success or failure).

You should keep polling this endpoint until the status is successful. The swap is complete when the `status` field in the response is `success`. This typically means polling until you see the transaction data in the response.
