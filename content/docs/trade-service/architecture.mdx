## Trade Service Architecture

While the [Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL)](/docs/okto-layer/ull) provides the core infrastructure for cross-chain token transfers, the Trade Service builds on top of this foundation to deliver a comprehensive, user-friendly token swap experience. This page explains how the Trade Service extends ULL's capabilities and simplifies integration for developers.

## Core Components

The Trade Service consists of several specialized components that work alongside ULL:

### 1. **Intelligent Pathfinder**

The Pathfinder is a sophisticated routing engine that analyzes all possible paths between source and destination tokens. It considers factors like:

- Price impact and slippage
- Gas costs across chains
- Execution speed
- Security considerations
- Current market conditions

Based on this analysis, it determines the optimal route for each swapâ€”which might involve direct ULL transfers, additional aggregator steps, or a combination of both.

### 2. **Aggregator Integration**

While ULL efficiently handles transfers of major assets across chains, the Trade Service extends this to support virtually any token through smart integrations with various DEX aggregators and bridges.

For a complex swap like "TOKEN-A on Chain 1 to TOKEN-B on Chain 2" where neither token is directly supported by ULL, the Trade Service orchestrates a sequence like:

1. **Pre-processing:** Convert TOKEN-A to a ULL-supported token (e.g., USDC) on Chain 1 with the help of a DEX aggregator.
2. **Cross-chain Transfer:** Move USDC from Chain 1 to Chain 2 via ULL
3. **Post-processing:** Convert USDC to TOKEN-B on Chain 2

This entire multi-step process is abstracted into a single, simple request for the end user.

### 3. **Risk Management System**

The Trade Service implements a comprehensive risk management system to protect users and ensure reliable operation.

**Risk Mitigation Features:**

- **Real-time Price Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of price feeds to detect anomalies
- **Slippage Protection:** User-defined slippage parameters with reasonable defaults
- **Transaction Deadlines:** Automatic expiration for stale transactions
- **Circuit Breakers:** Automatic suspension of trading during extreme market conditions

## How Trade Service and ULL Work Together

The Trade Service and ULL form a powerful partnership that leverages their respective strengths:

**Complementary Roles:**

- **Trade Service**: Provides the easy to integrate APIs, user-facing interface, token support, and intelligent routing
- **ULL**: Serves as the core execution engine that drives cross-chain settlements

**Typical Flow:**

1. **User Request**: Application calls Trade Service API with swap parameters
2. **Route Analysis**: Trade Service analyzes the request and determines optimal path
3. **Pre-processing**: If needed, Trade Service prepares token conversion steps
4. **Intent Creation**: Trade Service creates a formal intent structure for the core cross-chain transfer
5. **ULL Execution**: The intent is passed to ULL for cross-chain settlement
6. **Post-processing**: If needed, Trade Service completes final token conversions
7. **Result Delivery**: The completed transaction details are returned to the application

Throughout this process, ULL handles the secure cross-chain asset movement while Trade Service manages the end-to-end user experience.
