description: Explore the Trade Service swap scenarios including same-chain swaps and various cross-chain swap flows.
---

This page outlines all supported swap flows within the **Okto Trade Service**, including both same-chain and cross-chain scenarios. Each swap operation is executed via a sequence of on-chain transactions, some of which may involve routing, cross-chain transfers, or intermediate conversions. These steps are abstracted from the end-user to ensure seamless and secure execution.

<Callout title="Understand FST and Non-FST Tokens" type="info">
- **FST (Filler Supported Tokens):** Tokens natively supported by the ULL (Unified Liquidity Layer) and eligible for direct cross-chain transfers.
- **Non-FST (Filler Unsupported Tokens):** Tokens not supported by ULL for cross-chain transfers. These must be first converted to an FST before moving across chains.

For more details, check the [Supported Networks & Tokens](/docs/trade-service/supported-networks-tokens) guide.

## 1. Same Chain Swap (Non-FST → FST/Non-FST)

This is an intra-chain swap, where both the source and destination tokens exist on the same blockchain. The transaction is performed within the user's wallet address and does **not** involve any cross-chain messaging or transfers.

**Example-** Swap WETH (Non-FST) to USDT (FST) on the Base network.

## 2. Pure Cross-Chain Bridge (FST → FST)

In this scenario, a supported FST token is transferred from the source chain to the destination chain. Both source and destination tokens must be FSTs.

**Example-** Swap USDC (FST) on BSC to USDC (FST) on Ethereum.

## 3. Cross-chain + Destination Swap (FST → Non-FST)

This scenario begins with a FST on the source chain, allowing direct cross-chain transfer via ULL. After the token is transferred to the destination chain, it is then swapped into a Non-FST using a same-chain swap.

**Example-** Swap USDC on BSC (FST) to ETH on Ethereum (Non-FST).

## 4. Source Swap + Cross-chain (Non-FST → FST)

<img src="/images/trade-service-swap-scenario-4.png" alt="Scenario 4: Source Swap + Cross-chain (Non-FST → FST)" width={700} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

In this scenario, the user starts with a Non-FST on the source chain. Because Non-FST tokens cannot be directly transferred across chains, the system first converts it to a FST using a same-chain swap. The resulting FST is then moved to the destination chain.

**Example:** Swap ETH (Non-FST) on Ethereum to USDC (FST) on Base.

## 5. Source Swap + Cross-chain + Destination Swap (Non-FST → Non-FST)

<img src="/images/trade-service-swap-scenario-5.png" alt="Scenario 5: Source Swap + Cross-chain + Destination Swap (Non-FST → Non-FST)" width={700} style={{maxWidth: "100%"}} />

This is the most comprehensive swap flow, involving a Non-FST on both the source and destination chains. The source Non-FST is first converted to an FST, then transferred across chains, and finally swapped again to the target Non-FST.

**Example:** Swap ETH (Non-FST) on Ethereum to SHIBA (Non-FST) on BSC.
