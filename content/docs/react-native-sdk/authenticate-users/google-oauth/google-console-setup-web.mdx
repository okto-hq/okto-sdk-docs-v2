2. Click on "Create" to start setting up your consent screen.
3. Choose the user type for your application (Internal or External) and click "Create".
4. Fill out the required fields on the consent screen configuration form:
    - Application name: Enter the name of your application.

## Getting Your Expo Configuration

Your Expo username and app slug are required for setting up the redirect URL. These can be found in your `app.json`:

<CollapsibleCallout type="info" title="Finding Your App Details">
In your `app.json`, look for:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "owner": "your-username",
    "slug": "your-app-slug"
  }
}
```
If `owner` is not set, it will use your Expo username.
</CollapsibleCallout>
</Step>

<Step>
## Creating a Web Client ID
1. Navigate to the "Credentials" page under "APIs & Services" in Google Cloud Console.
2. Click on "Create credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".
3. Choose "Web application" as the application type.
4. Add the following configurations:
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins:**
     ```
     https://auth.expo.io
     ```
   - **Authorized redirect URIs:**
     ```
     https://auth.expo.io/@your-username/your-app-slug
     ```
     Replace `your-username` and `your-app-slug` with your actual Expo username and app slug.

5. Click "Create" to generate your web client ID.
6. Copy the client ID - you'll need this for your app's Google Sign-In configuration.

<CollapsibleCallout type="warning" title="Important">
Make sure to:
- Use your correct Expo username and app slug in the redirect URI
- Include both the JavaScript origin and redirect URI exactly as shown
- Keep the `@` symbol in the redirect URI
</CollapsibleCallout>
</Step>

<Step>
## Conclusion
You have successfully set up a project in Google Console and generated the web client ID for Google authentication. You can now use this client ID in your Expo application's Google Sign-In configuration.

<CollapsibleCallout type="tip" title="Next Steps">
Return to the quickstart guide and use your web client ID in the Google Sign-In configuration:

```typescript
const [request, response, promptAsync] = Google.useAuthRequest({
    webClientId: 'YOUR_WEB_CLIENT_ID', // Add it here
    // ... other configuration
});
```
