### **Idea**  

A “super-app” letting users handle assets, NFTs, or bridging across different blockchains in a single interface.

### **How Okto Helps**

- **Unified Portfolio:** Okto’s Portfolio & Balances API aggregates user balances across networks, so you can build a consolidated dashboard with minimal code.  
- **Easy Cross-Chain Swaps:** Integrate bridging or aggregator logic, while Okto automatically determines the best path or bridging solution.

### **Example**

- **All-in-One Crypto Management:** Stake on Solana, claim NFTs on Polygon, and manage stablecoin balances on Ethereum from one app.  
- **Multi-Network DEX Aggregation:** Show the best swap routes across chains while letting Okto handle multi-chain token transfers.

## How to Get Started

We support multiple frameworks including React, React Native, Next.js, and TypeScript. Each comes with optimized SDKs and starter templates to help you build faster.

Check out our [SDK Overview](/docs/okto-sdk/supported-sdk-platforms) to find the best framework for your needs, then use our starter templates to begin building. Start with basic features like authentication and token transfers, then scale up to more complex functionality as needed.
