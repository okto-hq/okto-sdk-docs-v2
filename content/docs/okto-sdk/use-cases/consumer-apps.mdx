### **Idea**  

You want to build a Web3 consumer app that feels as simple as a traditional web applicationâ€”no complicated wallet or seed phrase flows.

### **How Okto Helps**

- **Easy Auth:** Use [Google OAuth, Email OTP, or Phone OTP](/docs/react-sdk/authenticate-users/okto-auth) to onboard users with minimal friction. 
- **MPC-Backed Wallets:** Okto automatically creates and manages user wallets under the hood, removing the usual complexity of seed phrases and private key management. Leverage Okto's [Embedded Wallet](/docs/react-sdk/wallets) to embed wallets seamlessly in your front-end.  
- **Cross-Chain Transactions:** If you need to handle multiple blockchain networks in one app, Okto's chain abstraction handles it through straightforward functions. Explore [`tokenTransfer()`](/docs/react-sdk/tokenTransfer) for fungible assets or [`nftTransfer()`](/docs/react-sdk/nftTransfer) for NFTs.

### **Example**

- **Decentralized Social Media:** Token-based reward systems for content creators and easy membership token gating.  
- **Digital Identity Management:** Storing and verifying user credentials on-chain, with user-friendly logins.
