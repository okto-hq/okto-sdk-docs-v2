### **Idea**  

You want a chatbot to handle DeFi trades, fetch user balances, or even stake tokens on behalf of users inside popular messaging apps.

### **How Okto Helps**

- **Server-Side SDK:** Use Okto's TypeScript SDK in your bot's backend to handle token transfers, NFT operations, and custom transactions. Your bot can execute these operations based on user commands.
- **Transaction Status:** Track transaction status in real-time using our SDK methods to provide immediate feedback to users in your chat interface.
- **Portfolio Management:** Easily fetch user balances across multiple chains, enabling commands like "!portfolio" to provide comprehensive overviews of users' assets.

### **Example**

- **DeFi Alerts & Automation:** The bot automatically harvests yield, checks for liquidation triggers, or invests in new pools.  
- **Social Trading:** Users in a Telegram group can share or copy trades with quick confirmation steps, powered by Okto behind the scenes.
