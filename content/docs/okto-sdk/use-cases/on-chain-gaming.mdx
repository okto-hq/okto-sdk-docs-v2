### **Idea**  

You’re building a blockchain-based game in which items, characters, or currency are NFTs or tokens that players truly own and can trade freely.

### **How Okto Helps**

- **MPC Wallet Security:** Protect players from losing their precious in-game NFTs. Okto’s multi-party computation approach secures user accounts from single-point-of-failure attacks.  
- **NFT Transfer & Mint:** Use Okto’s NFT APIs to mint new weapons, characters, or gear. Your code can look as simple as [`transferNft()`](/docs/react-sdk/okto-embedded-wallet/use-user-embedded-wallet/transfer-nfts) to transfer an NFT, while Okto handles the complexity.  
- **Cross-Game Portability:** If you plan to let users move items across multiple titles or blockchains, Okto’s cross-chain capabilities unify everything under one developer interface.

### **Example**

- **Play-to-Earn Mechanics:** Reward active gamers with on-chain tokens or unique NFTs.  
- **NFT-Based Avatars & Equipment:** Let players keep their weapons, skins, or collectibles in personal wallets, easily tradable on external markets.
