### **Idea**  

You run an established Web2 service (e.g., e-commerce, a streaming platform, or a social app) and want to weave in token-based features, crypto payments, or NFT memberships—without forcing your users through typical Web3 friction.

### **How Okto Helps**

- **Incremental Adoption:** Keep your existing UI and flows, but embed Okto’s wallet creation and token logic behind the scenes.  
- **Payment Processing:** Let users pay in stablecoins, while Okto auto-manages bridging or chain selection—ideal for global e-commerce expansions.  
- **NFT Memberships or Premium Access:** Issue membership tokens or coupons as NFTs. Okto’s integrated approach ensures your front-end remains simple and user-friendly.

### **Example**

- **Streaming Services:** Deploy a token or NFT “pass” for premium features, airdrop content-based tokens to loyal watchers.  
- **Splitwise-like Payment Apps:** Manage group expenses in stablecoins, handle multi-chain cross-settlements, or manage on-chain group wallets.

## How to Get Started

We support multiple frameworks including React, React Native, Next.js, and TypeScript. Each comes with optimized SDKs and starter templates to help you build faster.

Check out our [SDK Overview](/docs/okto-sdk/supported-sdk-platforms) to find the best framework for your needs, then use our starter templates to begin building. Start with basic features like authentication and token transfers, then scale up to more complex functionality as needed.
