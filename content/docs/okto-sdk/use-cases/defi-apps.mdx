### **Idea**  

You're building a DeFi application where users can stake, trade, track, and manage their positions across multiple protocols and chains - all from a simple, mobile-friendly interface.

### **How Okto Helps**

- **Seamless Transactions:** Okto handles gas fees, retries, and multi-step transactions behind the scenes. Users can stake, swap, or manage liquidity with minimal friction using our SDK methods.
- **Cross-Chain Portfolio:** Track and display user positions across multiple chains and protocols using our portfolio methods. Perfect for unified dashboards and position management.
- **Gas Sponsorship (Optional):** Enable users to interact with protocols even without holding chain-native tokens. Learn more in the [Sponsorship documentation](/docs/developer-admin-dashboard/sponsorship).

### **Example**

- **Mobile DeFi Hub:** Users can deposit collateral on one chain, borrow assets on another, and track everything in a single dashboard.
- **Yield Aggregator:** Show yield rates across protocols, enable one-click harvesting, and automate complex rebalancing strategies.
- **DAO Treasury Management:** Provide a consolidated view of protocol-owned liquidity, staked assets, and yield farming positions across multiple chains.
