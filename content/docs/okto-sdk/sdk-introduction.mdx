## What is Okto SDK?

The **Okto SDK** is a powerful wallet infrastructure that simplifies on-chain interactions for developers. It abstracts away the complexities of chains, liquidity, and gas - letting developers build apps where users transact across networks via social logins, intent-driven actions, and policy-controlled wallets, all with Web2 simplicity.

By acting as a comprehensive abstraction platform, the Okto SDK automatically handles most blockchain complexities. Rather than integrating multiple protocols or manually managing network details, developers can rely on Okto’s **plug-and-play** solution to create sophisticated Web3 features—ranging from token transfers to multi-chain interactions—via a streamlined, developer-friendly API.

What sets **Okto** apart is its ability to deliver **Web2 simplicity with Web3 power**. For developers, Okto provides **embedded wallet** infrastructure that works across 30+ ecosystems with minimal code. For end users, this unlocks **seamless onboarding** via social logins and signless transactions where they simply express desired outcomes.

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. Seamless Onboarding

Traditional blockchain applications require users to navigate complex steps: installing browser extensions, managing private keys, and remembering seed phrases. Okto changes this paradigm by providing **frictionless onboarding** via social logins and MPC wallets that eliminate seed phrases entirely.

Under the hood, **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)** handles user key creation and storage with **military-grade security**. When someone signs in with their preferred method (e.g., Google OAuth or email verification), Okto automatically provisions and manages their blockchain wallet in the background. This ensures:

- **Web2-like signup experience** that requires minimal blockchain knowledge  
- **Military-grade security** through MPC + TSS technology with EigenLayer security  
- **Non-disruptive** transitions between regular app usage and blockchain-enabled features  

### 2. Chain Abstraction Embedded Wallet

Okto provides a **single wallet interface that works across 30+ ecosystems** including EVM chains, Solana, and Aptos. This **embedded wallet** infrastructure removes cross-chain complexity for both users and developers:

- **Universal Wallets**: Access and manage assets across all major chains from one interface
- **Cross-Ecosystem Compatibility**: One wallet for EVM, Solana, Aptos, and more
- **Delegated Transaction Flows**: Users approve batches of actions with programmable guardrails

### 3. Intent-driven Signless Transactions

Making blockchain transactions work properly is usually one of the hardest parts of development. Developers need to handle complex payload constructions, gas estimations where the system is designed for high fluctuations, different blockchain ecosystems, and complex error cases.

Okto transforms this with **intent-driven** interactions where users express desired outcomes in simple terms

- Lets you provide the desired blockchain network as a parameter, eliminating the need to handle node providers, connection setups, or chain-specific configurations  
- Automatically estimates and manages gas fees  
- Abstracts transaction lifecycle management, including retrying failed transactions and monitoring their status  

As a developer, you define the **what** (e.g., "transfer tokens" or "invoke a smart contract"), and Okto handles the **how** behind the scenes, offloading most blockchain-specific boilerplate and keeping your codebase clean.

### 4. Gasless Transactions

Okto eliminates one of Web3's biggest friction points—the need for native tokens on every chain:

- **Pay in Stablecoins**: Users can pay fees in USDC or other stablecoins
- **Sponsored Transactions**: Apps can sponsor gas fees entirely for their users
- **No Native Tokens Required**: Interact with any chain without holding its native token
- **Simplified UX**: Remove the complexity of managing gas across multiple chains

### 5. Developer Simplicity

Okto SDK provides **multi-platform SDKs** that reduce integration time from months to days:

- **Minimal Code Required**: Integrate complete wallet infrastructure with just a few lines
- **Multi-Platform Support**: SDKs for React, Next.js, React Native, Flutter, Unity, iOS, Android
- **Self-Serve Dashboard**: Configure chains, tokens, and policies through an intuitive interface
- **Policy Engine**: Programmable transaction rules for spending limits and security requirements

## Integration Scenarios

### Web2 Projects Moving to Web3

For Web2 projects looking to integrate blockchain features, Okto provides a gradual, low-friction path. The SDK allows you to maintain your existing application architecture while adding Web3 capabilities. This approach is particularly valuable for:

- **E-commerce Platforms**: Accept crypto payments or introduce NFT-based loyalty rewards without rewriting your storefront  
- **Content Platforms**: Gate premium content with tokens or let creators issue NFTs to monetize their work  
- **Social Applications**: Enhance user engagement via token rewards, NFT collectables, or on-chain identities  

Throughout this incremental adoption, users continue to enjoy Web2-like UX while gaining access to new blockchain features.

### Web3 Projects: Expanding Capabilities

For existing Web3 projects, Okto simplifies multi-chain support and helps you reach a broader user base. Key benefits include:

- **Multi-chain Expansion**: Extend your dApp from one primary blockchain to multiple networks without additional bridging solutions  
- **Improved User Experience**: Implement simplified onboarding (social logins, OTPs) and frictionless in-app transactions  
- **Security**: Leverage Okto's infrastructure for key management and transaction signing

## Why Developers Should Choose Okto SDK

### Practical Advantages

- **Accelerated Development**: By offloading chain selection, transaction orchestration, and wallet management to the SDK, developers can focus on core application logic. With Okto, app development time can be reduced by up to 90%.
- **Reduced Complexity**: No need to manually configure network endpoints, handle seed phrases, or navigate different chain quirks.
- **Familiar Patterns**: Use standard REST/JS approaches instead of diving deep into raw blockchain logic.

### Technical Benefits

- **Unified Interface for Multi-Chain Operations**: Manage tokens, contract calls, bridging, and more across diverse ecosystems via a single API.  
- **Automatic Transaction Lifecycle**: Okto handles gas, retries, and asynchronous feedback so you don’t have to.  
- **Robust User Authentication**: MPC ensures high-level security without imposing complicated UI and wallet workflows on the user.

### Business Benefits

- **Faster Time-to-Market**: Shortened development cycles mean you can deploy blockchain features ahead of competitors.  
- **Lower Maintenance Overhead**: Okto’s managed environment and continuous upgrades reduce the headache of staying current with chain or wallet protocol changes.  
- **Better User Adoption**: A streamlined UX typically translates to higher customer satisfaction, retention, and conversion rates for any blockchain-based product.
