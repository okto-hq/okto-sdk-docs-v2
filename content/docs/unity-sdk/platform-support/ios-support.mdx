## Required iOS Configuration Steps

### 1. Configure URL Scheme in Unity

In the Unity Editor's iOS Player Settings, add a supported URL scheme named `oktosdk`.

This allows the Okto SDK to handle authentication callbacks via the `oktosdk://` URL scheme.

### 2. Update `Info.plist`

After exporting your Unity project to Xcode, open the `Info.plist` file and add the following entry:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
    <string>com.package.name</string>
    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
    <array>
      <string>oktosdk</string>
    </array>
  </dict>
</array>
```

### 3. Link `SafariServices.framework`

In Xcode:

- Select the **UnityFramework** target from the project navigator.
- Go to **Build Phases** â†’ **Link Binary With Libraries**.
- Click the **+** button and add `SafariServices.framework`.

This is required for web-view authentication to function properly.

If you experience issues, please double-check that all steps above have been completed correctly. In some cases, the issue may not be related to the Okto SDK. Conflicts or missing configuration in third-party libraries can also cause problems.
