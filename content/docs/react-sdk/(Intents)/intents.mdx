Intents make Web3 easy.  Instead of complex steps, you simply tell Okto your *intent* – what you want to achieve.  Okto handles the rest, making blockchain actions feel simple.

## What are Intents on Okto?

Intents are like simple instructions for Web3. You say what you want, not *how* to do it. The Okto Platform figures out the best way to make it happen.  The Okto Platform takes care of:

- **Breaking Down Complex Tasks:**  Intents become easy steps for the system.
- **Smart Fee Handling:**  Okto makes sure you pay the right amount for fees.
- **Automatic Steps:**  The system does all the work in the background.
- **Cross-Chain Made Easy:**  Moving things between blockchains is automatic.
