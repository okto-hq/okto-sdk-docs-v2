### Setup and Configuration

1. **React and Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have React set up in your project.
   - For a detailed list of required dependencies, refer to our [`package.json`](https://github.com/okto-hq/okto-sdk-react-template-app/blob/main/package.json).

2. **Okto API Key & Setup**
   - Obtain your API Key from the [Okto Dashboard](https://dashboard.okto.tech/).
   - Enable the required chains and tokens for your integration.
   - If you require sponsorship, enable it for the desired chains in the [Sponsorship Section](/docs/developer-admin-dashboard/sponsorship/using-sponsorship).

3. **Authentication Methods**

   The Okto SDK supports multiple authentication methods:

   - **Google OAuth**
      - To authenticate users via Google, you'll need to set up a Google Console Project.
      - Follow our guide to [set up your Google Console Project](/docs/react-sdk/authenticate-users/google-oauth/learn).
   - [**Email OTP**](/docs/react-sdk/authenticate-users/email-otp/learn)
   - [**Phone OTP**](/docs/react-sdk/authenticate-users/phone-otp/learn)
