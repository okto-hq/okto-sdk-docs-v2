## What is Okto?

Okto is a comprehensive wallet infrastructure to simplify on-chain interactions. Okto abstracts chains, liquidity, and gas complexities, enabling developers to build applications where users can transact across networks via social logins, intent-driven actions, and policy-controlled wallets, all with Web2 simplicity.

Okto addresses the core challenges preventing mainstream Web3 adoption:

- **Seamless Onboarding** via social logins and MPC wallets that eliminate seed phrases
- **Chain Abstraction** through embedded wallets that work across 30+ ecosystems
- **Intent-Based Transactions** where users express intents, not complex transaction steps
- **Gasless Operations** letting users pay in stablecoins or apps sponsor fees entirely
- **Developer Simplicity** with SDKs that reduce integration time from months to days

## Background & Motivation

While Web3 promises decentralization, transparency, and user empowerment, mainstream adoption has been hindered by challenges like:

- **Complex Wallet Management:** Users often need to juggle multiple wallets, manage private keys, and remember numerous seed phrases.
- **Diverse Gas Fee Requirements:** Navigating varying native tokens for gas across different networks complicates transactions.
- **Fragmented Liquidity and Bridging:** Moving assets between chains involves multiple protocols and bridging steps.
- **Inconsistent Developer Experiences:** Building on diverse blockchain networks often requires dealing with low-level details and bespoke integrations.

Okto was created to bridge these gaps by combining robust crypto primitives with a developer-friendly abstraction layer. Our goal is to make blockchain interactions as simple as “click and done,” allowing dApps to onboard users without friction and empowering developers to build innovative applications without deep blockchain expertise.
