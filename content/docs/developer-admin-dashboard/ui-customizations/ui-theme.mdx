The UI Theme customization allows you to tailor the visual aspects of the Okto wallet integration to match your app's design. These customizations will reflect across all UI screens.

## **Global Customization Options**

Two main customization options apply across all UI screens:

1. **Theme Mode**  

   * **Light Mode:** Ideal for apps with a brighter, day-time focused interface.  
   * **Dark Mode:** Suitable for apps with a darker theme or to reduce eye strain in low-light conditions.  
       
2. **Accent Color**  

   * Set using an RGB HEX value (e.g., #5166EEFF)  
   * This color will be applied to key UI elements like buttons and icons across all screens.
