## **Overview**

Sponsorship enables you to cover transaction fees (gas fees) for your users, creating a smoother experience by eliminating the need for users to hold native tokens for transaction fees.

## **How Sponsorship Works with Okto Across Ecosystems**

Sponsorship integrates with Okto's wallet infrastructure to automatically cover gas fees for transactions on supported chains for all transactions initiated by the client across users. When a user initiates a transaction, the sponsorship system pays the required gas fee, allowing the transaction to proceed even if the user doesn't have the native token for gas.

    * Enable chains in your [Okto Dashboard](https://dashboard.okto.tech)
    * Activate sponsorship individually for each of the enabled chains that needs sponsorship

<CollapsibleCallout type="note" title="Loading Funds to Sponsorship">

    * Only native tokens of the respective chains can be loaded into sponsorship accounts.

You can disable sponsorship on the developer dashboard if activated. If not activated, you don't need to activate it until you need to use it.

## Supported Operations Across Chains

- All chains: Gas fees
- Aptos and Solana: Account creation and initiation
- Solana specific: SPL ATA accounts, nonce advancement, rent

## Transaction Management

- Sponsorship accounts are segregated by client ID to ensure funds are used only within your application
- Current implementation covers all transactions for your users
- Future updates will introduce conditional sponsorship coverage

<Callout title="Note">
**You have full authority over your sponsorship account. Neither Okto nor any third party can drain your sponsorship funds.**
</Callout>

## Low Balance Scenarios
If your sponsorship account balance is low:
- You'll receive notifications via the SDK and API.
- You can either recharge the account or disable sponsorship to prevent transaction failures. Incase you disable sponsorship, fee will be directly deducted from the user's account who initiates the transaction. **This means the user must hold native tokens of the destination chain on which the transaction is being executed on.**


## Best Practices
1. Regularly monitor your sponsorship account balances.
2. Consider the transaction volume and gas prices on each chain when funding your sponsorship accounts.
3. Periodically review your sponsorship strategy to ensure it aligns with your application's needs and user behavior.
