<Callout title="Note">
**MAWs (Monthly Active Wallets)** refers to the total number of unique wallets that have initiated **a new session** in a web3 app at least once. 

**A session** is defined as either a transaction, such as an airdrop or redemption, or an active interaction that triggers an API call to the Okto platform.

Each wallet's sessions are capped at a maximum of 5 per month (30 days). Therefore, if a unique wallet completes 12 sessions, it will count as 3 MAWs (12/5=3, rounded up to the nearest whole number).
