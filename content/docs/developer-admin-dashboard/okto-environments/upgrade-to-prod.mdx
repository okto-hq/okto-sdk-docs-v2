title: Upgrade to Production
description: Comprehensive guide for migrating your application from Okto Sandbox to Production environment

## Overview

Once you've successfully tested all features in the Sandbox environment, you can migrate to Okto's production environment. This page outlines everything you need to prepare before submitting your production migration request.

<Callout type="warn">
Before proceeding with production migration, ensure that:
1. All features have been thoroughly tested in Sandbox
2. Legal and commercial agreements with Okto have been finalized
3. Scale estimations are ready for infrastructure planning
</Callout>

## Prerequisites for Production Migration

### 1. Client Dashboard Access

Production dashboard differs from Sandbox:

- **Single Email Access**: Only one whitelisted email address can access the production dashboard per client
- **Business Domain Required**: Must use a business domain email (Personal emails are not accepted)

<Callout type="info">
If multiple team members need access, create a shared business email that all authorized personnel can access.
</Callout>

### 2. Wallet Type Decision (Critical)

<Callout type="warn" title="Important Decision">
This is a one-time, irreversible decision that affects your wallet infrastructure.
</Callout>

The type of wallet you choose will determine your infrastructure capabilities:

#### **Option A: AA (Account Abstraction) Wallets** - Choose if:
- You plan to sponsor gas fees for your users on any EVM chain. It enables gasless transactions for a better user experience.
- You plan to add EVM sponsorship capabilities in the future.

#### **Option B: EOA (Externally Owned Account) Wallets** - Choose if:
- You do NOT require sponsorship on EVM chains.
- You're certain you won't need EVM sponsorship in the future.
- **EOA wallets cannot be upgraded to AA wallets later** (until Pectra upgrade is live on the required chains).

<Callout type="warn" title="Critical">
Even if you're currently using only non-EVM chains (Solana, Aptos), if you might add EVM chains with sponsorship later, choose Option A (AA wallets) now. This decision cannot be changed after production deployment.
</Callout>

**Note**: This decision only applies to Okto SDK users. If you're using External Wallet Adapters or Trade Service, this doesn't apply.

### 3. JWT Authentication Setup (If Applicable)

For SDK users implementing JWT authentication:

- **JWT Endpoint Whitelisting**: Your JWT endpoint URL needs to be whitelisted by Okto for production use.
- **Endpoint Format**: The endpoint should return a valid JWT token for authenticated requests.
- **Endpoint Accessibility**: Ensure the endpoint is accessible and properly configured.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test your JWT endpoint in the Sandbox environment before migrating to production.
- **Contact Support**: If you need to change the JWT endpoint after deployment, contact Okto support as this is restricted for security reasons.

### 4. Scale Estimations

Provide expected usage metrics for infrastructure planning:

- **Max Concurrent Users**: Peak simultaneous users expected
- **Orders Per Minute**: Average transaction volume per minute
- **Max Orders Per Hour**: Peak hourly transaction volume
- **Orders Per Day**: Total daily transaction volume

These metrics help us provision appropriate infrastructure for your production environment.

### 5. Contract Whitelisting Requirements

Prepare lists of tokens and NFTs your users will interact with:

#### **Token Whitelisting**

Format: `[Token Name] – [Contract Address URL on chain explorer]`

#### **NFT Whitelisting**

Format: `[NFT Collection Name] – [Contract Address URL on chain explorer]`

<Callout type="info">
You can also whitelist contracts directly through the Client Dashboard after production access is granted.
</Callout>

## Code Changes Required

### For API Integration

Update your base URL from Sandbox to Production:
```
Sandbox: https://sandbox-api.okto.tech
Production: Will be provided upon production access
```

All other API endpoints and parameters remain the same.

### For SDK Integration

When initializing the Okto client, change the environment parameter from `sandbox` to `production`:
```javascript
<OktoProvider 
   config={{ 
      environment: "production", // Changed to "production" for production environment
      clientPrivateKey: process.env.CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY, 
      clientSWA: process.env.CLIENT_SWA, 
   }} 
>
   {children}
</OktoProvider> 
```
