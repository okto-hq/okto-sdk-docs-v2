## What is Sandbox?

The Sandbox is a secure testing environment that mirrors the production setup but with controlled conditions. This is the default environment available to developers on Okto. It allows developers to:
    - **Experiment with Okto Features:** Test all available features without impacting live data.

    - **Test Integrations:** Validate your applicationâ€™s integration in both testnet and mainnet environments.

    - **Simulate Scenarios:** Explore various workflows, error handling, and edge cases without incurring costs or affecting real user data.



## Sandbox Limitations

2. **Number of Projects**:  
    - Currently, only one project is enabled per user.
3. **Feature Restrictions**:
