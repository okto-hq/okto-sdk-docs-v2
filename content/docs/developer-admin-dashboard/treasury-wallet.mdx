## Overview

A Treasury Wallet in Okto is a client-controlled Smart Wallet Account (SWA). Unlike end-user SWAs, Treasury Wallets serve as your (the client's) on-chain identity, allowing you to perform blockchain operations directly.

Treasury Wallets, Sponsor Wallets, and User Wallets are all [DWN](/docs/okto-layer/dwn) based smart contract wallets, sharing similar underlying technology but differing in their intended use and management.

**Key Use Cases for Treasury Wallets:**

- **Client-Side Chain Interactions:** Execute transactions or interact with smart contracts directly from a wallet you control. This is useful for operations like airdrops, DApp-specific administrative functions, or any scenario where your application logic needs to initiate an on-chain action.
- **Aggregated Transaction Execution:** Can be used for operations like batch token transfers or aggregated smart contract interactions.

4. Once you've selected a chain, you'll be presented with a QR code and wallet address specific to that chain.

5. Transfer a small amount of the native token from that chain (e.g., ETH for Base, MATIC for Polygon) to the provided address.

> **Important**: Always ensure you're sending tokens via the correct chain only, to avoid losing your funds. The wallet address shown is specific to the selected blockchain network.
