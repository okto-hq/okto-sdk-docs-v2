## What Are Okto Credits?

Okto Credits are testnet tokens ($OKTO) that serve as the native fee token on the Okto Testnet, functioning like gas tokens on any EVM-compatible chain. Clients need $OKTO to execute transactions on the Okto Chain.

### Examples of Transactions on the Okto Chain:
- **User Onboarding**: When a user is onboarded, their Smart Wallet Account (SWA) is deployed on the Okto Chain.
- **User Authentication**: Upon authentication, the user's unique session details must be registered on their SWA on the Okto Chain.
- **Transaction Execution**: Actions such as token transfers, NFT transfers, or raw transaction execution create jobs on the Okto Chain.

<Callout type="info">
All operations on the Okto Chain require $OKTO tokens to cover transaction fees. Without sufficient credits, your application's functionality will be limited during development.
