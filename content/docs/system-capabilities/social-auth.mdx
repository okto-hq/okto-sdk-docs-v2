## What is Social Authentication?

Social authentication allows users to sign into your Web3 application using their existing accounts from trusted social platforms like Google, Whatsapp, or X. This approach eliminates the need for users to create new accounts or remember additional passwords, significantly reducing friction in the Web3 onboarding process.

When using Okto with social authentication, you get:

- **Familiar User Experience**: Users can sign in with accounts they already trust and use daily
- **Reduced Onboarding Friction**: No need to explain seed phrases or private keys to new Web3 users
- **Enhanced Security**: Leverage the robust security infrastructure of established social platforms
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Consistent authentication across web, mobile, and desktop applications
- **Automatic Wallet Creation**: Okto automatically creates blockchain wallets for authenticated users
