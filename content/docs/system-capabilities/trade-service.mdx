## Introduction

The Okto Trade Service is a powerful API suite designed for developers looking to incorporate seamless cross-chain token swap functionality into their applications. It acts as the primary gateway to the capabilities of Okto's underlying Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL), abstracting away the complexities of multi-step bridging and swapping operations.

With the Trade Service, you can offer your users the ability to swap virtually any token on one supported chain for any other token on another supported chain through a single, simplified interface.

<Callout type="info" title="Flexible Integration Options">
The Trade Service offers two primary integration paths:

1. **Via Okto Embedded Wallets:** Use Swap Intents through the Okto SDK for a fully integrated experience with built-in wallet management.
2. **Via Any External Wallet:** Use the Trade Service APIs directly to get transaction objects that can be signed and executed by any wallet provider (e.g., MetaMask).

This flexibility ensures you can leverage Okto's powerful swap infrastructure regardless of your existing wallet setup or user preferences.

## Core Functionality at a Glance

The Trade Service uses an intent-based approach, focusing on what the user wants to achieve rather than how it needs to be done:

1.  **Unified Swap Requests:** Your application submits a request specifying the source token/chain, destination token/chain, and amount. (See [ULL Supported Chains and FSTs](#) for more details).
2.  **Intelligent Routing:** The Trade Service employs a sophisticated Pathfinder to determine the most optimal execution route. This considers factors like best price, lowest gas fees, execution speed, and slippage across various liquidity sources.
3.  **Seamless Execution:** It automatically coordinates all necessary steps behind the scenes. This may involve:
    * Utilizing integrated DEX Aggregators (like 1inch, Socket, etc.) for efficient on-chain swaps if the source/destination tokens aren't directly Filler/Solver-Supported Tokens (FSTs). ([Learn more about Fillers/Solvers](/docs/trade-service/trade-service-actors)).
    * Leveraging the Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL) for the core secure cross-chain asset transfer via its network of solvers/fillers. ([Read the detailed explanation of ULL](/docs/okto-layer/ull)).
4.  **Abstraction:** Developers and users don't need to manually interact with different bridges, DEXs, or manage multi-step transaction processes. The Trade Service handles the orchestration.

## Key Benefits

* **Simplified Integration:** Provides a single API endpoint for complex cross-chain swaps.
* **Optimal Execution:** Automatically finds and executes the most efficient swap routes.
* **Broad Token Coverage:** Access swaps for a vast range of tokens via integrated aggregators.
* **Enhanced User Experience:** Offers users a simple "one-click" experience for cross-chain swaps.
