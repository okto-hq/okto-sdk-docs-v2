## What is an Embedded Wallet?

An **embedded wallet** is a cryptocurrency wallet seamlessly integrated into an application, such as a dApp, website, or traditional web app. Unlike standalone wallets or browser extensions, embedded wallets are directly built into the application, offering a streamlined and intuitive user experience. 

Powered by Okto’s [**Decentralized Wallet Network (DWN)**](#), embedded wallets simplify blockchain interactions by providing a consolidated view of user assets across multiple chains and enabling chain-abstracted transactions.

Developers can leverage [Okto’s SDKs](../okto-sdk/supported-sdk-platforms) to easily build embedded wallets into their apps, whether on web or mobile platforms. These wallets bring the power of Okto's infrastructure to end users, hiding blockchain complexities and enabling seamless asset management.

## Key Features of Embedded Wallets

### 1. **Unified Asset Management**
Users can view and manage assets across multiple chains (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Aptos) in a single wallet interface.

### 2. **Chain-Abstracted Transactions**
By tapping into Okto's DWN, embedded wallets allow users to transact without worrying about the underlying chains, token standards, or gas fees.

### 3. **User-Friendly Onboarding**
Integrated with familiar authentication methods (e.g., email, social login), embedded wallets remove the need for seed phrases and make onboarding simple for users with no prior blockchain experience.

### 4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
Okto's embedded wallets work seamlessly across web and mobile environments, providing consistent functionality and user experience.

### 5. **Advanced Security**
Embedded wallets leverage the **multi-party computation (MPC)** and trusted execution environments (TEEs) of Okto's DWN to ensure private keys are never fully exposed, delivering high security for users’ digital assets.

## Use Cases of Embedded Wallets

### 1. **Web2 Applications**
Web2 applications are traditional, centralized web services that most internet users are familiar with. Integrating embedded wallets into these applications can introduce blockchain features without overhauling the entire platform. Here's how embedded wallets enhance Web2 apps:
- **Cryptocurrency Payments**: E-commerce platforms or service-based websites can integrate embedded wallets to accept cryptocurrency payments. Users can make purchases or subscriptions using digital assets without leaving the familiar interface of the Web2 application.
- **Tokenized Rewards**: Loyalty programs can use embedded wallets to distribute and manage tokenized rewards. Users earn, store, and redeem these tokens within the app, providing a seamless rewards experience enhanced by blockchain technology.
- **NFT Integration**: Media platforms, social networks, or content creation sites can use embedded wallets to allow users to mint, buy, sell, or showcase Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This brings the world of digital collectibles into traditional web spaces.
- **Blockchain-based Identity**: Web2 applications can leverage embedded wallets for decentralized identity solutions. Users can manage their digital identity and credentials within the app, potentially using them across multiple services.


### 2. **Web3 Applications**
Web3 applications are decentralized apps (dApps) built on blockchain technology. Embedded wallets in this context aim to simplify the often complex user experience associated with Web3. Here's how they're utilized:
- **Simplified dApp Interactions**: Embedded wallets allow users to interact with smart contracts, decentralized exchanges, or other blockchain services directly within the dApp interface. This eliminates the need to switch between the dApp and a separate wallet application.
- **Gas Fee Management**: Embedded wallets can handle gas fee calculations and payments behind the scenes, simplifying one of the most confusing aspects of blockchain interactions for many users.
- **Multi-chain Support**: Advanced embedded wallet solutions can manage assets and interactions across multiple blockchain networks, all from within a single dApp interface.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Access**: DeFi platforms can use embedded wallets to provide seamless access to complex financial operations like lending, borrowing, or yield farming, making these services more accessible to a broader audience.
- **Governance Participation**: DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and other blockchain-based governance systems can use embedded wallets to simplify the process of voting and participating in governance decisions.

## Bridging Web2 and Web3

Embedded wallets play a crucial role in bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3:
1. **Gradual Adoption**: They allow Web2 applications to gradually adopt blockchain features without alienating users unfamiliar with crypto.
2. **Familiar UX**: By integrating blockchain functionality seamlessly, embedded wallets maintain a familiar user experience while introducing powerful Web3 capabilities.
3. **Reduced Friction**: Embedded wallets significantly reduce the friction of onboarding new users to Web3, as they don't require separate wallet creation or management.
4. **Interoperability**: Advanced embedded wallet solutions can offer interoperability between Web2 and Web3 ecosystems, allowing users to leverage their digital assets across various platforms.

By integrating embedded wallets, both Web2 and Web3 applications can offer enhanced functionality, improved user experiences, and easier access to blockchain technology. This integration is a key step in the broader adoption of Web3 technologies across the digital landscape.

## Interoperable vs. Closed-Loop Wallets
When it comes to embedded wallets, there are two main types: interoperable wallets and closed-loop wallets. Understanding the differences between these two can help developers and users choose the right solution for their needs.

### Interoperable Wallets
Interoperable wallets are designed to work across multiple platforms, networks, and applications. They offer flexibility and broad compatibility within the blockchain ecosystem.

#### Key Features
1. **Multi-Chain Support**: Interoperable wallets can manage assets across various blockchain networks, such as Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.
2. **Cross-Platform Functionality**: Users can access their wallet across different applications and services, maintaining a consistent identity and asset portfolio.
3. **Broad Asset Support**: These wallets typically support a wide range of cryptocurrencies and tokens, including those from different blockchain ecosystems.
4. **DApp Compatibility**: Users can interact with various decentralized applications (DApps) using the same wallet.
5. **Unified User Experience**: Despite working across multiple platforms, interoperable wallets strive to provide a consistent user interface and experience.

### Closed-Loop Wallets
Closed-loop wallets are restricted to a specific platform, application, or network. They offer a more controlled and often simplified user experience within a particular ecosystem.

#### Key Features
1. **Platform-Specific**: Designed to work within a single application or a limited set of related applications.
2. **Tailored Functionality**: Features are often customized to suit the specific needs of the platform or application.
3. **Simplified Asset Management**: Usually support a limited range of assets relevant to the specific ecosystem.
4. **Integrated User Experience**: Deeply integrated with the host application, providing a seamless and cohesive user experience.
5. **Controlled Environment**: Offer more control over user interactions and asset movements within the defined ecosystem.

The choice between interoperable and closed-loop wallets largely depends on the specific needs of the application and its users. **Interoperable wallets** are ideal for applications that aim to provide users with access to the broader blockchain ecosystem. On the other hand, **Closed-loop wallets** are more suitable for applications with specific, contained use cases.

**Okto Lite** Wallets are **Interoperable Wallets**, allowing for flexibility and broad ecosystem integration. This aligns with our goal of making blockchain technology more accessible and user-friendly across various applications and use cases.
