Clients in the Okto ecosystem can manage user onboarding, sponsor gas fees for user transactions, and perform their own on-chain operations. Okto provides two specialized wallet constructs to support these client activities: **Treasury Wallet**, **Paymaster Wallet**, and **Sponsor Wallet**.

<Callout type="info" title="Info">
- Treasury, Paymaster, and Sponsor wallets can be created and managed via the Okto Developer Dashboard.
- For a step-by-step guide, check out the [Treasury Wallet Dashboard Guide](/docs/developer-admin-dashboard/treasury-wallet).
</Callout>

## 1. Treasury Wallet

The Treasury Wallet serves as the client's own on-chain identity. It allows clients to perform on-chain actions independently of user wallets (e.g., invoking their own smart contracts, executing airdrops, or other DApp-specific operations).

- **Key Features:**
    - **Client-Initiated Transactions:** Execute transactions directly from a wallet controlled by the client.
    - **Aggregated Transaction Execution:** Can be used for operations like batch token transfers or aggregated smart contract interactions.

## 2. Paymaster Wallet

The Paymaster Wallet is a specialized wallet that authorizes and validates gas sponsorship when the sponsorship feature is enabled.

- **Key Features:**
    - **Sponsorship Authorization:** Serves as the authorizing entity (`feePayerAddress`) for transactions where gas fees are covered by the Sponsor Wallet.
    - **No Funding Required:** The Paymaster Wallet does not require any funds. Its sole purpose is to authorize gas sponsorship.

<Callout type="warn" title="Note">
A Paymaster Wallet set as the `feePayerAddress` is **required** to enable gas sponsorship for user transactions.
</Callout>

## 3. Sponsor Wallet

The sponsor wallet is primarily designed for **gas sponsorship**. The Sponsor Wallet holds the funds that will be used to pay gas fees for user transactions on supported blockchain networks, enabling a gasless experience for your users.

- **Key Features:**
    - **Gas Fee Sponsorship:** Automatically covers transaction fees for user operations when sponsorship is enabled for the specific chain and a valid Treasury Wallet is set as the fee payer.
    - **Funding Mechanism:** Clients deposit funds directly into the Sponsor Wallet via the Okto Developer Dashboard. These funds are then used exclusively for gas sponsorship.
    - **Chain-Specific Sponsorship:** Clients can enable sponsorship and fund Sponsor Wallets on a per-chain basis.
    - **Policy Integration:** (Future scope) Clients will be able to specify policy constraints (e.g., daily volume limit, per-transaction limit) to manage sponsored funds.
