Okto provides several mechanisms for integrating wallet functionalities into decentralized applications (dApps). These options include dedicated adapters for popular Web3 frontend libraries, which facilitate the use of Okto's embedded wallets, typically accessed via social logins.

These solutions offer developers flexibility in how users connect to and interact with their dApps, catering to different existing technical stacks and future integration needs.

## Okto Wagmi Adapter

The Okto Wagmi Adapter enables the integration of Okto's embedded smart contract wallets, accessed via social login (e.g., Google), into applications built with the [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) library of React hooks.

- The Okto Wagmi Adapter allows dApps utilizing Wagmi to offer Okto as a wallet option, thereby providing users with an Okto-managed embedded smart contract wallet.
- The adapter presents Okto (via social login like GAuth) as a connection choice. Upon successful user authentication with a social provider, an Okto embedded wallet is created or accessed and made available to the dApp through standard Wagmi hooks and interfaces.

- **Key Features:** Facilitates user onboarding via social logins within Wagmi-based applications, allowing interaction with the dApp using the connected Okto wallet.

- **Limitations:** While providing robust wallet functionality, access to certain advanced, Okto-native features such as the full intent-based execution model may be limited when compared to direct integration with Okto's core SDKs, as the adapter conforms to Wagmi's standard connector patterns.

## Okto RainbowKit Adapter

For dApps employing [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com/) for wallet connection UIs, Okto offers an adapter to seamlessly integrate its embedded wallet functionalities. Users can select Okto via a social login option within the RainbowKit modal to connect an Okto embedded smart contract wallet.

- The Okto RainbowKit Adapter enables RainbowKit-based dApps to offer Okto as a wallet provider, allowing users to onboard using social logins and utilize an Okto-managed embedded smart contract wallet.
- The adapter registers Okto as a connector within the RainbowKit system. When a user selects Okto and authenticates via a social provider, an Okto embedded wallet is provisioned and interfaced with the dApp through RainbowKit's standard UI and underlying Wagmi functionalities.

- **Key Features:** Streamlines user onboarding by offering social login options through the familiar RainbowKit interface, connecting an Okto wallet for dApp interactions.

- **Limitations:** Similar to the Wagmi adapter, the RainbowKit adapter standardizes the Okto wallet interaction to fit within its framework. For deeper integration with Okto's unique features, such as the intent system, direct use of Okto SDKs is generally recommended.
