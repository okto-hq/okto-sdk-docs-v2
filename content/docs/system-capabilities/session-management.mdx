Session management is a critical component of the Okto Ecosystem that provides a mechanism for applications or vendors to interact with Okto services without requiring the user’s primary private key for every transaction. By employing ephemeral session keys, Okto minimizes the exposure of long‑term credentials while enabling a seamless Web2-like experience.

## Session Key Flow

1.  **Client-Side Session Key Generation:** When a user initiates a login through an Okto-integrated dApp, the client application generates a unique session key pair. This key pair is ephemeral and specific to the user's current session. The **private key** is securely stored locally on the user's device, while the **public key** is used for signing.

2.  **Authentication Request to Gateway:** The client application constructs an authentication request containing:
    *   **Login Credentials:** User authentication tokens (e.g., Google OAuth token, Email OTP, Phone OTP).
    *   **Session Public Key:** The newly generated session public key.
    *   **Signature:** A signature generated using the session private key, proving ownership of the session key pair.
    This request is sent to the Okto Gateway.

3.  **Decentralized Verification (Auth Module):** The Gateway passes the request to the Auth Module. The Auth Module, operating as a decentralized network, independently verifies the user's login credentials against the respective authentication provider (e.g., Google Auth service). A consensus mechanism ensures that authentication is trustless and resistant to spoofing.

5.  **Key Generation and User Setup:** Upon successful authentication, the Auth Module communicates with the Decentralized Wallet Network (DWN). The DWN, if necessary, generates the user's blockchain identity by generating cryptographic keys (ECDSA/EdDSA) using Multi-Party Computation (MPC). The public keys of the session and the user's wallet address are then relayed to the Okto Chain.

6.  **On-Chain Registration (Okto Chain):** The final step involves registering the user's identity on the Okto Chain via a User Operation (UserOp). This registration links the session public key to the user's Smart Wallet Account (SWA).
