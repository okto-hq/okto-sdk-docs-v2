## What is Okto's Abstraction Approach?

Blockchain adoption faces significant challenges due to fragmented ecosystems, complex user experiences, and liquidity issues. **Okto** addresses these hurdles by hiding the underlying complexities of blockchain technology, enabling seamless, user-friendly experiences across chains, transactions, and wallets.

Okto achieves this by combining cutting-edge solutions like **chain abstraction**, **transaction abstraction**, **wallet abstraction**, and **liquidity abstraction** into a unified architecture. This ensures that developers and end-users can interact with blockchain ecosystems as intuitively as they would with Web2 applications.

## The Five Dimensions of Okto's Abstraction

Through its innovative architecture, Okto simplifies blockchain interactions across five critical dimensions:

### 1. **Chain Abstraction**

Okto’s infrastructure is **chain-agnostic**, supporting both EVM and non-EVM chains like Solana, Aptos, and Cosmos. Developers and users no longer need to manage chain-specific details, enabling:
- Simplified integration for developers building cross-chain applications.
- Seamless multichain interactions for users with a single wallet interface.  

With chain abstraction, applications can reach users across multiple ecosystems without requiring users to understand the technical differences between chains.

### 2. **Transaction Abstraction**

Complex blockchain transactions often require multiple steps across different protocols. Okto eliminates the complexities of blockchain transactions by handling:
- **Payload management:** Automating retries and error handling.
- **Nonce management:** Avoiding transaction failures due to manual nonce mismanagement.
- **Bundled transactions:** Sequencing and parallel execution of multi-step transactions.

This allows developers to focus on building applications while Okto handles the technical heavy lifting behind the scenes. [Learn more](/docs/okto-layer/dtn)

### 3. **Wallet Abstraction**

Okto’s **Decentralized Wallet Network (DWN)** enables:

- **Social login:** Use Google, Apple, or other familiar authentication methods instead of seed phrases.
- **Unified portfolio view:** One wallet interface to manage assets across all supported chains
- **Session-based permissions:** Temporary access grants without compromising security. [Learn more](/docs/system-capabilities/session-management)
- **Secure key management:** Multi-Party Computation (MPC) ensures private keys are never fully exposed, protecting users against single points of failure.

### 4. **Liquidity Abstraction**

Fragmented liquidity across chains forces users to manually bridge assets and navigate complex DEX interfaces. Okto's Universal Liquidity Layer (ULL) and Trade Service solve this through:

- **Optimal Path Routing:** Automatic selection of the most efficient bridges and swaps
- **ERC-7683 implementation** - Supporting the cross-chain intent standard for seamless liquidity access
- **Solver-settler network** - Optimizing routes for the best possible prices and execution
- **Any-to-any token swaps** - Moving assets between any supported blockchains with one click

The ULL enables users to move assets between chains without manually bridging, and developers to access liquidity across the entire ecosystem without complex integrations.

### 5. **Gas Abstraction**

The need to hold native tokens for gas on each chain is a major friction point. Okto eliminates this through:
- **Sponsored Gas:** Applications can sponsor fees entirely for their users
- **Gas Station Network (GSN):** Users can pay transaction fees in stablecoins, eliminating the need to hold native tokens for gas fees across different chains. Okto handles converting assets to cover gas requirements.

This enables true Web2-like experiences where users never need to understand or manage gas fees.

## The Future of Blockchain: Web2-Like Simplicity

Okto enables Web3 applications to deliver experiences comparable to Web2 platforms like PayPal or Venmo. By handling blockchain complexities behind the scenes, Okto empowers developers to build **retail-friendly** applications.

The future of blockchain with Okto is one where:
- Users interact with applications through familiar interfaces without worrying about seeds, bridges, or gas
- Developers build across multiple chains without learning chain-specific code
- Applications can access users and liquidity from any ecosystem, not just their native chain
- Complex multi-chain operations are executed with simple one-click actions
