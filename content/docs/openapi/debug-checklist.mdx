## Environment and Setup Debugging

### Development Environment

- [ ] **Environment Variables**: Confirm all required environment variables are set
- [ ] **API Keys**: Verify API keys are valid and have necessary permissions
- [ ] **SDK Version**: Ensure you're using the latest SDK version
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Check that all required dependencies are installed

### Dashboard Configuration

- [ ] **Okto Credits**: Verify sufficient [Okto Credits](/docs/developer-admin-dashboard/okto-faucet) in your account
- [ ] **Network Settings**: Confirm required networks are enabled in dashboard
- [ ] **Token Whitelist**: Check that tokens you're using are whitelisted
- [ ] **Sponsorship Settings**: If using sponsorship, verify it's properly configured

## Sponsored Transaction Debugging

If your sponsored transaction is not working, follow this checklist to identify and resolve the issue:

### Prerequisites Check

- [ ] **Chain and Token Enabled**: Ensure the required chain and tokens are enabled in your [Okto Dashboard Chains & Tokens](/docs/developer-admin-dashboard/wallet-control)
- [ ] **Mainnet Chains**: Verify you're using mainnet chains (sponsorship is only supported on mainnet)
- [ ] **Sponsorship Enabled**: Confirm sponsorship is enabled for the destination chain in your [Okto Dashboard Sponsorship Page](/docs/developer-admin-dashboard/sponsorship)
- [ ] **Sponsor Wallet Activated and Funded**: Check that your Sponsor Wallet is activated and has sufficient deposited funds visible in the Okto Dashboard balance
- [ ] **Paymaster SWA Generated**: Verify that the Paymaster SWA is automatically generated (appears when you activate at least one sponsorship)

### Integration Check

- [ ] **Correct Paymaster SWA**: Ensure the correct Paymaster SWA is provided as `feePayerAddress` in your intent call. See the React SDK example [here](/docs/react-sdk/tokenTransfer#example).
- [ ] **Parameters**: Double-check all required parameters are included in your intent calls. 

### Isolation Testing : Test Without Sponsorship
  1. Disable sponsorship on the dashboard
  2. Remove the `feePayerAddress` from your request
  3. Test the same transaction with identical parameters
  4. **If successful**: This indicates a sponsorship-specific issue - provide error response, job ID, and request cURL for support
  5. **If still failing**: This suggests a payload/parameter issue unrelated to sponsorship

## Authentication Debugging

### Google OAuth Issues

- [ ] **Valid Google Client ID**: Ensure your Google Client ID is correctly configured
- [ ] **Authorized JavaScript Origins**: Verify your domain is added to Authorized JavaScript origins in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] **Authorized Redirect URIs**: Check that your redirect URIs are properly configured in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] **ID Token Validity**: Check that your Google ID token hasn't expired (tokens have short lifespans)
- [ ] **API Key Configuration**: Confirm your Okto API keys are properly set in environment variables

## Wallet and Transaction Debugging

### Wallet Creation Issues

- [ ] **Enabled Chains**: Confirm required chains are enabled in your [Dashboard Wallet Controls](/docs/developer-admin-dashboard/wallet-control)
- [ ] **Enabled Tokens**: Verify required tokens are whitelisted
- [ ] **User Authentication**: Ensure user is properly authenticated before wallet operations

### Transaction Failures

- [ ] **Sufficient Balance**: Check user has adequate token balance for the transaction
- [ ] **Gas Fees**: Verify sufficient funds for gas fees (if not using sponsorship)
- [ ] **Network Connectivity**: Ensure stable connection to the blockchain network
- [ ] **Transaction Parameters**: Validate all transaction parameters are correct and properly formatted

### Intent Execution Issues

- [ ] **Intent Type**: Confirm you're using the correct intent type for your operation
- [ ] **Required Fields**: Verify all required fields are included in your intent payload
- [ ] **Address Formats**: Check that all addresses are properly formatted for the target chain
- [ ] **Token Addresses**: For native tokens, use empty string instead of contract address

---

## API Integration Debugging

### Request Issues

- [ ] **Endpoint URLs**: Verify you're using the correct API endpoints for your environment
- [ ] **HTTP Methods**: Confirm you're using the correct HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
- [ ] **Request Headers**: Check that all required headers are included and properly formatted
- [ ] **Content-Type**: Ensure `Content-Type: application/json` is set for POST requests

### Response Issues

- [ ] **Status Codes**: Check HTTP status codes for error indicators
- [ ] **Error Messages**: Review error response messages for specific issue details
- [ ] **Rate Limits**: Verify you're not hitting API rate limits
- [ ] **Network Timeout**: Check for network timeout issues
