<Step>

## 4. Save Your API Keys

From this tab, you will find the API Key and the API Secret Key. Copy the first two marked keys: API Key and API Key Secret. You will need these to authenticate via X and get the access token.

</Step>

<Step>

## 6. Set Up User Authentication

To enable user authentication, click **Set up** in the User authentication section.

**Choosing App Type:**

- **Native App:** Select this if you are building a mobile or desktop application that runs directly on a user's device (e.g., iOS, Android, Windows, or Mac apps). Native apps are considered public clients and typically cannot keep secrets secure.
- **Web App, Automated App or Bot:** Select this if you are building a web application, server-side app, or a bot. These are confidential clients that can securely store secrets and are suitable for most web-based integrations or backend services.

## 7. Configure Callback URLs

Configure the callback URLs for your application. These URLs are used by X to redirect users after they authorize your app.

**What to enter:**

- **Callback URI / Redirect URL:** Enter the URL where users should be redirected after they authorize your app. This is usually an endpoint in your app that handles the OAuth callback, such as `https://yourapp.com/auth/callback`.
- **Website URL:** Enter the main website address for your app or service, such as `https://yourapp.com`. This is shown to users during the authorization process.
