## Authorization in Okto SDK

Authorization in Okto SDK revolves around the **Okto Auth Token**, a secure credential used to authenticate and authorize requests from your application to Okto services. Understanding how Okto Auth Tokens are generated, formatted, and verified is crucial for building secure Okto-powered Web3 applications.

### What is an Okto Auth Token?

The Okto Auth Token is central to how Okto manages authentication and authorization. Whenever a user logs in to your application (whether by email, social login, or external wallet signature), Okto issues a JSON Web Token (JWT)—that encodes key information about the user and the specific client (your app).

Essentially, the Okto Auth Token is a unique JWT generated by Okto, combining:
- User's login credentials
- Client API Key
- Session Data

  Okto Auth Tokens are valid for 7 days.

Okto SDK uses the Auth token to:

- **Verify Application Identity:**  Ensures requests are originating from your authorized application (identified by your API Key).
- **Authenticate User Sessions:**  Confirms that the user interacting with your application is authenticated and has an active session.
- **Authorize Access to Resources:** Controls access to Okto's backend services and user-specific data based on the token's validity and permissions.

### How the Okto Auth Token is Generated

1. **User Initiates Login:** The user can log in via social login or via external wallet connection.

2. **Okto Validates Credentials:** Okto checks credentials against your application’s configuration, verifying the user’s identity and your API key.

3. **Token Minted:** If the login is successful, Okto issues an Auth Token.

4. **Token Delivered:** The token is returned to your front end (or wherever you initiated the login), so you can use it to make subsequent calls or maintain the user’s session.

<Callout title="Note">
You typically won’t handle token signing/verification details yourself; Okto handles it under the hood. However, you can inspect or verify the token in detail if needed.
</Callout>

### Okto Auth Token Verification

For debugging or understanding the token's contents, you can manually verify the Okto Auth Token using online JWT decoders like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).

1.  **Copy the Okto Auth Token string.**
2.  **Go to [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).**
3.  **Paste the token into the "Encoded" text area.**
4.  **jwt.io will decode the token, displaying the Header, Payload, and Signature.**
5.  **Check the Payload section for relevant claims:**
    *   **`exp` (Expiration Time):**  Verify the token's expiration time to ensure it's still valid.
    *   **User identifiers, application identifiers:** User details like email.

### Managing Expired Auth Tokens

When an Okto Token expires, subsequent API requests using that token will fail.  Okto SDK provides mechanisms to help you handle token expiration.
