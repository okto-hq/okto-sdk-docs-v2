## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Embedded Wallets

Okto enables users to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance the security of their embedded wallets. When MFA is enabled, any action that requires the private key—signing messages, sending transactions, exporting the wallet, or recovering the wallet on new devices—will also require additional verification.

## Why MFA?

- **Added Security:** Even if someone obtains the user’s device or password, they must pass an additional challenge to use the wallet.
- **Smooth UX:** Okto will provide built-in flows to prompt MFA only when needed, minimizing friction.
