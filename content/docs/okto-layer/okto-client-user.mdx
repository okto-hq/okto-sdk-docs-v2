description: "In the Okto documentation, you'll frequently encounter three main personas: Wallet Provider(WP), Client, and User. These personas are key to navigating how Okto interacts with developers and users across its platform. Let's break down each of these roles to understand their place in the ecosystem."

## Dive deep into what & how each personas work

<PersonaDescriptionCard 
  title="Wallet Provider"
  description="A Wallet Provider is the entity responsible for the underlying wallet infrastructure and the specific ecosystem of wallets made available to users through Client applications. Okto itself acts as a Wallet Provider (e.g., with Okto AA and Okto EOA wallets), and in the future, other entities might also assume this role within the Okto framework."
  whatItDoes={[
    "Manages the underlying wallet infrastructure.",
    "Defines a distinct wallet ecosystem and its interoperability rules.",
    "Provides wallet services that Client applications integrate for their Users.",
    "Can set default policies for its ecosystem."
  ]}
  whatItIs={[
    "Can be Okto itself (providing Okto AA/EOA wallets) or a third-party entity.",
    "Forms the foundation upon which Clients build their user-facing applications.",
    "Each Wallet Provider creates a boundary for direct wallet/asset interoperability between different Wallet Provider ecosystems."
  ]}
  howToIdentify={[
    "Users' wallets are tied to a specific Wallet Provider through the Client application and login method they use."
