A single API call empowers developers to build powerful token-based dApps without blockchain complexities.</em>\n\n## Introduction: The Power of Tokens with Okto\n\nTokens are at the heart of blockchain applications. Whether you’re building DeFi platforms, gaming ecosystems, or NFT marketplaces, tokens drive user interactions and utility. However, <strong>working with tokens across multiple chains</strong> has historically been a nightmare.\n\nEach blockchain has its own standards for accounts, token handling, and transaction flows, forcing developers to:\n\n- Learn chain-specific models (e.g., account-based vs. UTXO).\n- Construct intricate transaction objects.\n- Manage gas fees, nonce handling, and retries.\n\nThis fragmented experience has made cross-chain development a daunting task.\n\n<strong>Enter Okto.</strong> Okto abstracts away these challenges, offering a seamless and unified way to interact with tokens across diverse ecosystems. With Okto, transferring tokens (whether native, ERC20, or other fungible assets) across any of the diverse chains becomes as simple as one API call. No chain-specific nuances, no transaction complexity. Just a clean, developer-friendly experience.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to enable blockchain networks (chains) and whitelist tokens on the Okto dashboard. We’ll also dive into various API functions provided by the Okto SDK that allow you to interact with tokens.\n\nBy the end of this guide, you’ll be equipped to integrate token interactions into your applications, unlocking the full potential of cross-chain development without the blockchain headaches.\n\n## Enabling Chains and Whitelisting Tokens\n\nBefore you can start interacting with tokens, it’s essential to configure which <strong>blockchain networks (chains)</strong> and <strong>tokens</strong> your application will support. This configuration is done through the Okto dashboard’s <strong>Wallet Controls</strong> feature.\n\n### Enabling Chains\n\nChains represent the blockchain networks your users can access. By enabling specific chains, you determine which blockchain ecosystems your users can interact with through their Okto wallet.\n\n<strong>To enable a chain:</strong>\n\n1. Log in to the <strong>[Okto Dashboard](https://dashboard.okto.tech/login)</strong> and navigate to the <strong>Chains & Tokens</strong> section of the <strong>Wallet Controls</strong> page on your Okto dashboard.\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*c0EkmhNNHjk5skKanJmgcQ.png\" alt=\"Enable Chain\" />\n\n2. Click on the <strong>Enable Chain</strong> button.\n\n3. In the pop-up window, you’ll see a list of available chains, including <strong>mainnet</strong> and <strong>testnet</strong> options.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*KIhZL0TYAW80kfILkmWucg.png\" alt=\"Enable Chain\" />\n\n4. Select the <strong>chain(s)</strong> you want to enable for your users.\n\n5. Click <strong>Enable Chain(s)</strong> to confirm your selection.\n\n### Enabling Tokens\n\nTokens represent the cryptocurrencies and digital assets your users can manage within their Okto wallet. You can choose from a list of whitelisted tokens for each enabled chain to ensure the assets relevant to your app are available to users.\n\n1. Log in to the [Okto Dashboard](https://dashboard.okto.tech/login) and navigate to the <strong>Chains & Tokens</strong> section of the <strong>Wallet Controls</strong> page on your Okto dashboard.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*c0EkmhNNHjk5skKanJmgcQ.png\" alt=\"Enable Token\" />\n\n2. Click on the <strong>Enable Token(s)</strong> button.\n\n3. In the pop-up window, you’ll see a list of available tokens for the enabled chains.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*RFmq7tM21-Iu5rUhkKHxlg.png\" alt=\"Enable Token\" />\n\n4. Select the token(s) you want to enable for your users.\n\n5. Click <strong>Enable Token(s)</strong> to confirm your selection.\n\n<img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*sH5Nz0JwwZ4P79fMCZjBIw.png\" alt=\"Enable Token\" />\n\n## Interacting with Tokens via Okto SDK APIs\n\nNow that you’ve enabled the desired chains and tokens, you can start interacting with them using the <strong>Okto SDK APIs</strong>. These APIs abstract the complexities of cross-chain operations, allowing you to perform critical actions like token transfers, portfolio management, and transaction tracking — all with just a few API calls.\n\n## 1.
